# build-path [![Build status for build-path on Circle CI.](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/build-path/master.svg "Circle Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/build-path "Build Path Builds")

> Get a path for the given build.

## Why?

 - Asserts that all necessary metadata is present.
 - Uses relative paths for flexibility.
 - Platform and technology agnostic.

## Install

```sh
npm install build-path --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const buildPath = require('build-path');
```

Get the path where a given build should live.

```js
const path = buildPath({ branch : 'master', version : '1.0.0'});
console.log(path);  // => build/master/1.0.0
```

Build paths cannot be constructed with incomplete data.

```js
buildPath({ version : '1.0.0' });
// TypeError: A branch is required to create the build path.
```
